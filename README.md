# E‑Commerce Sale Analysis 🛒📊
Project Overview

A data‑analysis project that unpacks and visualizes sales data for an e‑commerce store. Utilizes a dashboard built in Power BI to provide insights into sales trends, top‑performing products, customer behavior, and overall revenue performance.

# 📈 Key Features / What You Can Do

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales dataset: sales volume, revenue over time, product performance, and customer segmentation.

Visualize key metrics such as monthly/daily sales trends, best‑selling products, revenue distribution across categories.

Generate interactive dashboards and reports for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions (inventory management, marketing, sales strategies).

Provide business‑insight outputs: underperforming products, seasonality / demand trends, customer purchasing patterns.

# 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

Power BI — for data visualization and dashboard creation

Python / Pandas (optional) — for data cleaning / preprocessing 

Excel / CSV — for storing and handling sales data before visualization

# ✅ Usage / How to Run

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lector2002/E-Commerce-Sale-Analysis.git
```

Open the E‑commerce Sales Dashboard.pbix file in Power BI Desktop (or Power BI service)

Load the dataset from the dataset/ folder (or re‑import if using a cleaned version)

Explore different dashboard views: sales over time, product performance, customer segment reports, etc.

(Optional) If you add data cleaning or preprocessing scripts, run them first before loading data into Power BI

# 🔍 What’s Inside 

Sales records: including order date, product ID, product category, quantity sold, sale price, customer metadata (if available)

Aggregated metrics: total revenue, units sold per product, monthly/quarterly/annual sales trends, product category breakdown

Derived business metrics: best‑selling products, slow‑moving inventory, revenue growth rate

# 🧭 Potential Extensions / Future Work

Add automated data cleaning and preprocessing scripts in Python for raw data ingestion

Incorporate customer-demographics analysis (if data available): purchase frequency, retention, lifetime value

Build predictive models for sales forecasting (monthly/seasonal forecasting)

Deploy dashboards on Power BI Service and enable periodic data refresh for live analytics

# 📚 About / Motivation

This project was created to showcase practical skills in data analysis, data visualization, and business‑driven data interpretation. It demonstrates how sales data can be turned into actionable insights to support decision‑making in e‑commerce. Great for data analyst portfolios, interviews, or small‑business analytics demonstrations.
